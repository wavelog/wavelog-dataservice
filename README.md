# Wavelog Dataservice
A simple data handler that provides easy-to-use APIs. The required data is typically large and cumbersome, which is why we offer it as a public service instead of storing it in Wavelog installations.
This service is available under https://data.wavelog.org/.

The code was not published yet. It will be ready to selfhost in a few weeks.
